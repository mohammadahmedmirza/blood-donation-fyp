          <h2>About us</h2>
          <p>
            We are a group of software developers from Forman Christian College
            University, Lahore, Pakistan aiming at making a genetic, life
            threatening disease of thalassemia manageable. Currently, more than
            100,000 people are diagnosed with Thalassemia in Pakistan, most of
            whom can live a normal life with regular blood transfusions.
            However, finding blood donors on a regular basis is mind wobbling
            and troublesome for the patients and abrogate them from living a
            normal life.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the power of technology, we aim to make the lives of
            thalassemia patients easier by arranging donors for them. Donating
            blood is also considered ‘Sadqa-e-Jaria’ but donors are restricted
            to wait for blood donation camps to give this ‘Sadqa’. After
            required screening, our website will link the donors with the
            patients in a hassle-free manner.
